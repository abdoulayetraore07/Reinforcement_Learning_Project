# Reinforcement Learning Project: Maze 

Here's our repository dedicated to Reinforcement Learning. A small project will be conducted and used as a course project at ENSTA Paris.

We aim here to implement different Reinforcement Learning algorithms in order to exit a maze first

You'll find here several folders :

/Include is for the headers

/src is for the algorithms and the environments by themselves.

/Data is for the maze in format txt.

/Our algorithm for the first evaluation is named RL_temp.c : 

It contains the different parts and functions provided by the teacher and our functions. 
It's possible to choose for the moment between two functions for the policy: epsilon_greedy and  Boltzmann's exploration.
We notice that the first policy takes less time for execution than the second.
Detailed descriptions can be found in the algorithm.
